# SQL Budget Program

My purpose for creating this program was to practice SQL queries and executing them through a python program. I chose a budget because it was a way to enter many items into the database and then filter them by the dates that they were enterd.

# Relational Database

This data base has one table, the transactions table. the items that get put into have an auto incrementing id, the transaction amount and the date that it was enterd into the database. when displaying the items in the database it will only show the items that are from the month that you are currently in.

The transactions table has ID, Amount, and Date. This table has the date in the formate of YYYY-MM-DD
